# Hey, I'm Sander.

I design and develop digital products, web applications and websites. I work from my office in the heart of Breda, the Netherlands. 
I tweet [here](https://twitter.com/fishsander), write [here](https://medium.com/@sandervisser/) and some of the projects I am (or used to be) proud of are down here. â¬‡

## Tools

Tools are key. For design I use tools as Sketch, Figma, InVision, Marvel and the Adobe Suite. Depending on the needs of the project I can develop with technologies as HTML, CSS, Javascript (vanilla and frameworks like jQuery, React, Vue and Angular), Ruby on Rails, PHP, Gulp, Webpack, npm, SCSS and front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation. However, tools are just tools. Throw something fun at me.
