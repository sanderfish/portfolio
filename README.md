# Hey, I'm Sander.

I design and develop digital products, web applications and websites. I work mainly from my office in Breda, the Netherlands. 
I tweet [here](https://twitter.com/fishsander), write [here](https://medium.com/@sandervisser/) and some of the projects I am (or used to be) proud of are down here.

## Tools and technologies

I find new technologies exciting and am always in the lookout for new stuff. For design I use tools as pencil & paper, Sketch, Figma, InVision and Marvel. Depending on the needs of the project I develop with technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript (vanilla and frameworks like jQuery, React, Vue and Angular), Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, PHP, Gulp, Webpack, npm and SCSS. I know front end frameworks too, although I usually roll my own. Tools are just tools though. Throw something fun at me.
